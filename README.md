# Mine-Fire-Class-prediction
This repository contains the code and the dataset for the prediction of undergrounf mine fire class using a series of ML algorithms along with XAI techniques.
This repository contains code implementations for predicting fire class using machine learning models. The models included are:

Random Forest (RF)

XGBoost

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

The dataset used in this project consists of gas composition measurements, specifically the percentage of:

Oxygen (O₂)

Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Methane (CH₄)

Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)

Nitrogen (N₂)

The target variable is the Fire Class, which represents different fire conditions.

Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the literature and consists of input features representing gas concentrations and an output label for fire classification.
